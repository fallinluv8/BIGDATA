The robust discourse over the last two decades around the use of TRIPS flexibilities and, in particular compulsory licensing, had provided policy-makers, legislators and advocacy groups with a panoply of options to con- sider i22 in relation to various aspects of this flexibility: broad grounds, easy-to-use procedures, and royalty guidelines and rates that are not so onerous that they frustrate generic competition and hence access to affordable medicines. 6.1 Expanded Grounds for Compulsory Licences The expanded grounds for the issuance of compulsory licences that may be consid- ered are: The patent is not worked or not fully worked "
